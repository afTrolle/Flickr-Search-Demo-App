# Flickr Search Demo App

The goal of the app is to be able to search for images using [Flickrs' Search Api] (https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)


Search results should be shown in a list view or grid view, that can be selected in a side menu.
the searched images is clickable and takes you to a more detailed view where you can inspect image and get more information.
